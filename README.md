# FedFM: Anchor-based Feature Matching for Data Heterogeneity in Federated Learning, TSP

## Introduction

This repo is the official implementation of **FedFM: Anchor-based Feature Matching for Data Heterogeneity in Federated Learning** ([IEEE Link](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10286439) / [ArXiv Link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.07615)), which has been accepted by IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing.

We have open-sourced our codes on three libraries, including **Pytorch, PaddlePaddle, and MindSpore**! Please refer to the corresponding sub-folder for detailed README.
